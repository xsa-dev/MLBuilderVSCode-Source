-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is an early preview extension which provides a quick and easy way to to use ML.NET AutoML Features from VSCode.

The idea of the extension is for it to be as close to feature parity with Visual Studio's Model Builder. All features are using the ML.NET Cli to run the operations.

As Features are added to the ML.NET CLI, i'm planning on adding them as needed to the extension. 


## Current Features

- Picking the Scenario to use. Currently (classification, regression)
- Selecting the DataSet File (TSV or CSV)
